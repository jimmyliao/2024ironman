## ELI5 for Generative AI and Software Development
### ELI5 GenAI Day 01 - 寫在前言：為何會又啟動 2024 鐵人賽

![running](https://github.com/jimmyliao/2024ironman/blob/main/posts/images/01_running.jpg)


今年目標: 既然是 30 天的挑戰，理所當然就來個 30 天跑步紀錄 + 30 篇文章，主題應該是圍繞在最近的 GenAI，最終產出想要有幾個部分:

- 對象: 在 Gemini Cookbook 看到一個 ELI5 (Explain like I'm 5) 的概念，這次想要試著用這個解說方式，針對現在幾個主流的開發方式，生成式 AI 應用做一個易懂的文章說明
- 形式: 架構圖，文章，影片，程式碼
- 範例: 希望能有至少三至五個範例 (從 Jyputer Notebook 到 Full Stack App)
- 輔助: 既然這叫鐵人賽，年底又有幾場馬拉松要完賽，那就來個每天一個跑步紀錄吧！

## English Version
Since it's a 30-day challenge, the plan is to record 30 days of running along with 30 articles. The theme will revolve around the recent developments in Generative AI, and the final output is expected to include several parts:

- Audience: I came across the `ELI5` (Explain Like I’m 5) concept in the Gemini Cookbook. So I would like to try explaining the current moderen development methods and generative AI applications in an easy-to-understand way.
- Format: Diagrams, articles, videos, and code.
- Examples: At least 3 to 5 examples (ranging from Jupyter Notebooks to full-stack apps).
- Appendix: Since this is called the Ironman Challenge, and there are several marathons to complete by the end of the year, I’ll also include a daily running log!

I’ve set up a GitHub Repo. Please give it a Star! -> https://github.com/jimmyliao/2024ironman
